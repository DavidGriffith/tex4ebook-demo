**tex4ebook demo**
==================

---

This project is part of an ongoing experiment with Michal Hoftich's fine 
LaTeX package, tex4ebook (https://github.com/michal-h21/tex4ebook/). The 
objective is to make sure that a document may be processed into 
DVI/PS/PDF formats as well as those formats provided by tex4ebook (epub, 
epub3, and mobi) without rewriting anything or using ifdefs or worrying 
if the ebook render will look like garbage or have structural problems.


Book 1
------

This is a fairly simple example using the ````book```` document class.
Nothing special is going on.

Book 2
------

This book is rather more complicated and is essentially a distillation of
an ongoing project of mine to convert a privately published book typeset in
Pagemaker 5 to LaTeX.  The document class is ````memoir```, uses XeLaTeX
rather than regular LaTeX, and uses a lot of packages and font changes.
