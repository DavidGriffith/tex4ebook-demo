This project is part of an ongoing experiment with Michal Hoftich's fine 
LaTeX package, tex4ebook (https://github.com/michal-h21/tex4ebook/). The 
objective is to make sure that a document may be build with and without 
assistance from tex4ebook.  The upshot of this is to assure authors of a 
reliable means of writing books using LaTeX that can effortlessly be 
rebuilt for any of the ebook formats supported by tex4ebook (epub, 
epub3, and mobi).
