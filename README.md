This project is part of an ongoing experiment with Michal Hoftich's fine 
LaTeX package, tex4ebook (https://github.com/michal-h21/tex4ebook/). The 
objective is to make sure that a document may be processed into 
DVI/PS/PDF formats as well as those formats provided by tex4ebook (epub, 
epub3, and mobi) without rewriting anything or using ifdefs or worrying 
if the ebook render will look like garbage or have structural problems.
